# vEatherForecasting

## Description

This webpage was created to demonstrate the knowledge gained in the Server-Side APIs week in coding boot camp and as a part of the class assignment submission. The vEather (Weather, instead of W, I used my initial) was developed using HTML, CSS, JS technology, and third-party APIs like jQuery, Bootstrap, and Dayjs. The application displays the weather forecast for five(5) days for selected cities from the list. The application uses two different APIs to fetch the data. The geocoding API will give us the latitude and longitude of the selected location. These values are passed to the weather API to retrieve the five-day forecasting.
